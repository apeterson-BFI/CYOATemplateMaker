Creating a template file:

The template file consists of an html section, enhanced with template parameters surrounded by %s, and a choices section, which contains lines of plaintext with a corresponding template file to navigate to, and variable statements which can create or modified variables.

Overall structure:

HTML
...
html
...

CHOICES
text ; relative filename ; variable action : [variable action : ...]


Escapes

In the choices text section, ;; can be used to produce a literal ;.

VARIABLES

variables have a name and are all decimal type values

HTML template escapes

%% : emit a literal %

%var [varname:fmt]% : emit the value of literal varname with the numeric formatting specifier fmt.
(eg. %var money:$0.00%)

%TEST varname, threshold, PASS <HTML>, FAIL <HTML>%

template escapes can be nested inside of TEST's pass and fail sections
