Creating a template file:

The template file consists of a prestart section, an html section, enhanced with template parameters surrounded by %s, and a choices section, which contains lines of plaintext with a corresponding template file to navigate to, and variable statements which can create or modified variables.

Overall structure:

PRESTART

TEST varname, threshold, pass page, fail page
LOCAL refers to the current page in pass page, fail page. 

Multiple TESTS may be run. Each test is only run if all of the ones above if went to LOCAL.

If a test goes to local and there are no more tests beneath it, then HTML section can start

HTML

Html code is here.

Anything with % is an escape

%% is a literal %

%var [varname:fmt]% : emit the value of literal varname with the numeric formatting specifier fmt.
(eg. %var money:$0.00%)

%TEST varname, threshold, PASS <HTML>, FAIL <HTML>%


CHOICES

Each line is a choice, there must be at least one choice and can be up to 5.

A choice can have a test block before it starts. The choice won't be offered if the test fails. 
There must be at least one choice without a test qualifier.

[TEST varname, threshold]; text; filename (relative); ACTION ; [ACTION]...


ACTION

SET varname, value : creates a variable and assigns it a value, or assigns the value to the existing variable. SET must be used to assign a variable before any other actions can be used with that variable.

ADD varname, value : varname = varname + value
SUB varname, value : varname = varname - value
MULT varname, value : varname = varname * value
DIV varname, value : varname = varname / value
POW varname, value : varname = varname ^ value
SIN varname : varname = SIN(varname)
SUB2 varname, value : varname = value - varname
DIV2 varname, value : varname = value / varname
POW2 varname, value : varname = value ^ varname

FILE EXTENSION

Template files should have an ADV extension
